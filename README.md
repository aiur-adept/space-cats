space cats
===

I made a very simple game when I was in last year of high school called space cats.

It makes a useful sort of "game" to push engine development forward since it should
be relatively simple and clear to write the logic for.

To run it, first you need to install deps

`go mod tidy`

Then, to build the game, run `make space-cats`

The binary `space-cats` will be generated.
